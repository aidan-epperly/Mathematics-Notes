# Welcome to my Brain!

Hello to all who read this. My name is Aidan and I am an applied mathematician, quantum computing researcher, and lover of optimization and all things noncommutative. These are my notes, organized in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I love the Obsidian ecosystem particularly the extensive key-binding support for math and the internal wiki-style links.
## Why are these notes here?

For a long time now, I have been trying to emulate my [brother's blog](https://www.ethanepperly.com/) but for whatever reason I have been unsuccessful. Instead, I have decided that my "contribution" to math exposition will be these notes.

I hope that these notes will be useful to someone other than myself. I love math Wikipedia and have benefitted from it greatly, but the content is sometimes difficult to parse and it is often overly general by necessity.

At the end of the day, however, these are my own personal math notes. I have added some information specifically for readers without my background knowledge, but on the whole, these notes are about things that I care about. 
### Why GitHub?

It's free and people use it!
## Contributing

I don't really know why you would want to contribute to this project, but you are welcome to do so! Examples in particular are welcome as are questions and correction. If you think there is a typo, or if I have simply left something unfinished (perhaps accidentally) that you are interested in, please feel free to make an [issue](https://github.com/aidan-epperly/Mathematics-Notes/issues). I might not get to it for a while, but I will eventually.
