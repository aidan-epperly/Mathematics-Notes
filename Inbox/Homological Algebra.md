#Definition (Simplicial Complex) A *simplicial complex* is a set $S$ together with a collection $K$ of finite, nonempty subsets $\{x_{0},\dots,x_{n}\} \subseteq S$ such that if $\sigma \in K$, then all nonempty subsets  $\sigma' \subseteq \sigma$ are also in $K$. The *geometric realization* of $K$, denoted $|K|$ given $S = [n]$ is
$$
|K| = \left\{ (a_{1},\dots,a_{n}) \; \mid \; a_{i} \geq 0, \; \sum_{i} a_{i} = 1, \; \text{if } J = \left\{ i \; \mid \; a_{i} > 0\right\} \text{ then } J\in K\right\}.
$$
This is just a way of writing the simplex and all of its faces.

Let $K$ be a simplicial complex and $K_{n}$ the set of all $n$-simplices. To denote the fact that we want distinct, ordered vertices, we will write a simple
$$
[x_{0},\dots,x_{n}] = \sigma.
$$
This assumes a total ordering on $S$ and $x_{i} < x_{i+1}$.

#Definition (Chain Group) Given $K$, define
$$
C_{n} = C_{n}(K) = \text{formal free abelian group generated by } K_{n}.
$$
This may also be denoted by $\mathbb{Z}^{K_{n}}$. This is called the *chain group*.

#Definition (Boundary Operator) The boundary map 
$$
\partial_{n}: C_{n} \to C_{n-1}
$$
for each $n \geq 0$ mapping $\partial_{n}[x_{0},\dots,x_{n}]$ to
$$
\sum_{j = 0}^{n} (-1)^j [x_{0},\dots,\hat{x_{j}}, \dots, x_{n}].
$$

#Proposition $\partial_{n-1}\partial_{n} = 0$.

#Definition Let $Z_{n}$ be the kernel of $\partial_{n}$ and $B_{n}$ the image of $\partial_{n-1}$.

#Corrollary $B_{n} \subseteq Z_{n}$.

#Definition Define $H_{n} = Z_{n}/B_{n}$. This is called the *homology* of $K$.

#Example For the example earlier,
$$
\begin{align}
C_{-1} &= \left\{ \emptyset \right\} \\
C_{0} &= \langle [1],[2],[3],[4] \rangle  \\
C_{1} &= \langle [12],[13],[23],[24],[34] \rangle  \\
C_{2} &= \langle [123] \rangle 
\end{align}
$$
The space $H_{0}$ has dimension $1$ and $H_{1}$ also has dimension $1$ and all other $H_{n}$ have dimension $0$ as $\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces.

#Example If you compute $H_{1}$ of a Klein bottle (triangulated) you get 
$$
H_{1}(K) = \mathbb{Z} \oplus  \mathbb{Z}_{2}.
$$

Every "simplicial" map $f : K \to K'$ induces a map 
$$
f_{*} : H_{n}(K) \to H_{n}(K')
$$
for all $n$.

#Definition Let $K$ and $K'$ be simplicial complexes. A map of simplicial complexes is a function $f : S \to S'$ such that
$$
f(\sigma) \in  K'.
$$
This induces a map $f_{\#} : C_{n} \to C_{n}'$ by 
$$
f_{\#}([x_{0},\dots,x_{n}]) = \begin{cases}

\end{cases}
$$
