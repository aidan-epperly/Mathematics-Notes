## Introduction

Find solution to
$$
A_{1}A_{2}\dots A_{n} = I
$$
with $A_{i}\in GL_{r}(\mathbb{C})$.

#Problem Given conjugacy classes $C_{1},\dots,C_{n}$ do there exist matrices $A_{i} \in C_{i}$ with $A_{1}\dots A_{n} = I$.

#Problem Classify conjugacy classes $C_{1},\dots,C_{n}$ such that $A_{i}\in C_{i}$ multiply to $I$ is unique up to conjugation (rigid local systems). This was proved by Katz using *middle convolution*, a process that maps *rigid* tuples $C_{1},\dots,C_{n}$ invertibly to a rigid tuple in smaller dimensions.

#Problem What are the canonical solutions to the equation 
$$
\prod A_{i} = I?
$$
A canonical solutions are the finite orbits of $\langle \sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{n-1} \rangle$ on the set of conjugacy classes of solutions to the above. Here $\sigma_{i}$ is "switching" the $i$ and $i+1$'s entry up to conjugation. This ends up being similar to the fundamental group of a multiply punctured sphere
$$
\langle \sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{n-1} \rangle
$$
is the spherical braid group.
