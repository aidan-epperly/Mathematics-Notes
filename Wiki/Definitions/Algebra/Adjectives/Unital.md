## Definition

An algebraic object is called *unital* if it has an element that acts as a two-sided multiplicative identity.

## Examples

1. The [[Ring|ring]] of polynomials $\mathbb{K}[x]$ is a unital ring with unit $1$.
2. The [[Ring|ring]] of matrices $\mathbb{K}^{n \times n}$ is a unital ring with unit $I_{n}$.
3. All [[Field|fields]] are unital by definition.
