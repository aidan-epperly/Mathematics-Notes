## Definition

A group $(G, \cdot)$ is called an *Abelian* or *additive* group if the multiplication is [[Commutative Map|commutative]]. In these cases, the group may be written $(G , +)$ to denote that the multiplication should be taken to act like addition (which is generally assumed to be commutative).

## Examples
1. The integers $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ are an additive group.
2. All [[rings]]
