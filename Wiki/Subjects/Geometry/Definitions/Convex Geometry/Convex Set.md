## Definition

Given a real [[Vector Space|vector space]] $V$, a subset $C \subseteq V$ is called *convex* if given $v,w \in V$ and $\lambda \in [0,1]$ we have
$$
\lambda v + (1-\lambda)w \in  V.
$$
Equivalently, the set $C$ is convex if it is closed under [[Convex Combination|convex combination]].
