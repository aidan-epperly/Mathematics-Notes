## Definition

Let $V$ be a real [[Vector Space|vector space]] and let $x_{1},\dots,x_{n} \in V$. A *convex combination* is a linear combination
$$
\gamma_{1} x_{1} + \dots + \gamma_{n} x_{n} \in  V
$$
with $\gamma_{i}\geq 0$ and $\sum_{i} \gamma_{i} = 1$. In other words, a linear combination is convex if and only if it is both [[Conic Combination|conic]] and [[Affine Combination|affine]].
