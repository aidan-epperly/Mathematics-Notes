## Summary

*Convex geometry* is the study of [[Convex Set|convex sets]].

## Major Results
### Caratheodory's Theorem

Given a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$, every point $x \in \mathrm{conv}(S)$ can be written as a convex combination of at most $n + 1$ points in $S$.

### Krein-Milman Theorem

Every [[Compact Set|compact]] [[Convex Set|convex set]] is the closed [[Convex Hull|convex hull]] of its [[Extreme Point|extreme points]].
