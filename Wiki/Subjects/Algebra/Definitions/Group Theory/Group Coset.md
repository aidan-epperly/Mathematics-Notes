## Definition

Given $G$ a [[Group|group]] and $H \subseteq G$ a subgroup, for every element $g \in H$, the left coset of $H$ with respect to $g$ is
$$
gH = \left\{ gh \; \mid \;h\in  H \right\} = \left\{ gh^{-1} \; \mid \;h \in  H \right\}
$$
which is exactly the orbit $\mathcal{O}_{g}$ of the right [[Group Action|action]] of $H$ on $G$. The right coset of $H$ with respect to $g$ is 
$$
Hg = \left\{ hg \; \mid \; h \in  H \right\}
$$
which is the orbit $\mathcal{O}_{g}$ of the left actions of $H$ on $G$.
