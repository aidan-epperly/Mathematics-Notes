## Definition

A [[Group|group]] $(G, \cdot)$ is called an *Abelian* or *additive* [[Group]] if the multiplication is [[Commutative Map|commutative]]. In these cases, the [[Group]] may be written $(G , +)$ to denote that the multiplication should be taken to act like addition (which is generally assumed to be [[Commutative Map|commutative]]).

## Examples
1. The integers $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ are an additive [[Group]].
2. All [[Ring|rings]] $(R,+, \cdot)$ are additive groups $(R,+)$.
	1. The [[Group|group]] of units of $R$ form an Abelian [[Group]] $R^{\times} = (R \setminus \left\{ 0 \right\}, \cdot)$.s
