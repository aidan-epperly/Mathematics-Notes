## Definition

A sequence $\to M_{n} \overset{f_{n}}{\to} M_{n+1} \to$ of $R$-modules $M_{n}$ and morphisms $f_{n}$ such that 
$$
\mathrm{im}\,f_{n} = \mathrm{ker}\,f_{n+1}.
$$
for all $n$ is called *exact*.

## Examples

1. The sequence $0 \to M_{1} \overset{i}{\to} M_{2}$ is exact if and only if the map $i$ is injective.
2. The sequence $M_{1} \overset{p}{\to}M_{2}\to 0$ if and only if $p$ is surjective.
