# Definition

Given a [[ring]] $R$, the map $\_ \otimes_{R} N$ for $N$ a left $R$-module is an additive covariant functor on right $R$-modules.

# Properties

1. $\_ \otimes_{R} N$ is [[Properties of Tensor Functor#Tensor is a Covariant Functor|covariant]].
2. $\_ \otimes_{R} N$ is [[Properties of Tensor Functor#Tensor is Additive|additive]].
3. $\_ \otimes_{R} N$ is [[Properties of Tensor Functor#Tensor is Right Exact|right exact]].
