Suppose $f' : M \to N$ and $P \to M$, $Q \to N$ are [[Projective Resolution|projective resolutions]] of $M$ and $N$ modules. Then, there is a chain map $f : P \to Q$ compatible with $f'$. Also, if $g$ is another such map, then $f$ is chain homotopic to $g$, which is to say that there is $s_{i}: P_{i} \to Q_{i+1}$ such that $f-g = sd + ds$, which implies $f_{*} = g_{*} : H_{i}(P) \to H_{i}(Q)$.
