## Summary

Quantum information theory can be broadly defined as the noncommutative analog of information theory -- henceforth classical information theory. Measure spaces and random variables are replaces with their noncommutative analogs as are the notions of entropy and other related metrics. The category that we work in for quantum information theory is QProb which we describe below.

## Objects in QProb

The objects in QProb are [[von Neumann Algebra|von Neumann algebras]]. These are the natural noncommutative analog of measure spaces just as C\*-algebras are the natural noncommutative analog of locally compact Haussdorf spaces. Note that much of classical probability theory still fits in QProb since every commutative [[von Neumann Algebra]] is the algebra of random variables for some $\sigma$-finite measure.

## Morphisms in QProb

The morphisms in QProb are the [[Trace Preserving Completely Positive Maps]]. These maps are a good model for what can realistically happen in physical reality including quantum measurement, unitary evolution, hidden measurement, and other similar things.
